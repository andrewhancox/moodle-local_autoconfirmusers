## Purpose of the plugin

I don't like it but I keep having clients who wish to disable account confirmation, this plugin lets you do that.

## Set up guide

* Drop the plugin into the local directory
* Run the moodle update script
* Go to Site administration > Plugins > Local plugins > Automatically confirm users
* Check 'Auto confirm users' and click 'Save changes'

TODO
------
I would love to find an elegant way to stop the account confirmation email being sent...
